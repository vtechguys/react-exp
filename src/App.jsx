Besides JavaScript frameworks, you can also use them together with Web Components. They can also come in handy if you want to create a complex UX for a monolithic front-end, such as state-based functionality. On the other hand, CSS-in-JS is probably not for you if you are a beginner developer, want to create websites without a dynamic front-end, or appreciate simplicity and code readability. You might reasonably find that your go-to tools such as Sass or PostCSS are perfect for your goals and that you donâ€™t want to pick up a new technology just for the sake of novelty.`

          CSS in Js are evalauted at run time and for each render.
          <br />
          It is way more costly then plain old css...
          <br />
          the thing you trade off is view encapsulation...
          <br />
          but hey! you shouldn't need that in first place if you have
          <br />
          a good css architecture and if you have <br />
          a design system on top of then it's a all in all success. <br />
